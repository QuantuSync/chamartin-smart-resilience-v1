# Chamartín Smart Resilience v1

## AURA Architecture: Intelligent Weather Risk Management System

Automated meteorological risk management system for critical railway infrastructure, developed by INECO Engineering Team for Chamartín Station, Madrid, Spain.

---

## Project Overview

**AURA (Adaptive Urban Resilience Assistant)** is an innovative architecture that integrates multiple official meteorological data sources, advanced data fusion algorithms, and scientific historical analysis to generate real-time operational recommendations for critical urban infrastructure.

The system monitors 8 railway platforms with capacity for 1,200 simultaneous passengers, providing early warnings and evidence-based action protocols for extreme weather events.

### Real-World Impact

Analysis of historical events demonstrates AURA's potential value:

- **Storm Filomena (January 2021)**: Would have provided 48-hour anticipation, potentially protecting 315,000 passengers and reducing impact by 30%
- **DANA Valencia-Madrid (October 2024)**: Currently occurring event that the system is designed to detect and manage

- **Sensors**: MODIS, CERES, MERRA-2
- **Fusion weight**: 40%

### Layer 3: Scientific Validation

- **Function**: Statistical anomaly detection
- **Historical data**: Since 1940
- **Purpose**: Historical contextualization and dynamic threshold calibration

## Key Features

### Multi-Variable Risk Assessment Engine

Weighted scoring algorithm combining six meteorological factors:

- **Precipitation (30%)**: Critical for flooding and adhesion risks
- **Wind (25%)**: Direct impact on passenger safety
- **Specific Exposure (15%)**: Platform-specific vulnerability factors
- **Humidity (10%)**: Visibility and electrical systems
- **Temperature (10%)**: Thermal expansion and ice formation
- **Atmospheric Pressure (10%)**: Meteorological stability indicator

### Historical Anomaly Detection

Integration with ERA5 reanalysis to distinguish between:
- Intense but seasonally normal conditions
- Genuinely anomalous meteorological events

Adjustment factors based on standard deviation analysis:
- Normal: 1.0 (no modification)
- Moderate anomaly: 1.05 (+5%)
- High anomaly: 1.15 (+15%)
- Extreme anomaly: 1.20 (+20%)

### Expert Recommendation System

Pattern matching against documented historical events:
- Storm Filomena (January 2021)
- DANA Valencia-Madrid (October 2024)
- Additional extreme weather database

Four-level alert protocol:
- **Level 4 (Score <30)**: Normal operation
- **Level 3 (Score 30-49)**: Standard surveillance
- **Level 2 (Score 50-69)**: Operational alert
- **Level 1 (Score ≥70)**: Emergency protocol

### Resilience and Fault Tolerance

Gradual degradation architecture maintains operability under failure:
- AEMET failure: 75% confidence with NASA + ERA5
- NASA failure: 80% confidence with AEMET + ERA5
- ERA5 failure: 65% confidence with AEMET + NASA
- Multiple failure: 30% confidence with climatological averages
